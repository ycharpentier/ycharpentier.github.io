The player profiling project initiated by Clermont Foot 63 is part of a statistical transition framework for football teams. Indeed, since 2006, video analysis companies have been providing clubs with data that allows for a better understanding of their players' behaviors during a match. It has therefore become necessary to provide a statistical analysis of these large quantities of data. The player profiling project provides additional information on the characteristics of positions in a football team. The anonymized analyses provided in this document offer further insights into football positions.
