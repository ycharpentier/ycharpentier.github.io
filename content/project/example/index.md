# How do we plan the future e-truck network?

This report documents the research internship carried out at the Arctic University of Norway in the Industrial Engineering Department of Narvik. Over the past seven years, the use of electric cars and trucks has become increasingly widespread. Consequently, this electrification of freight transport vehicles will naturally impact supply chains, which must therefore be revised. This report is situated within this contemporary context, proposing to jointly study the optimal placement of charging stations and logistics infrastructures. The study, conducted independently and under the supervision of an internship advisor, resulted in the creation of a constraint-based optimization model addressing this issue. The core of this internship is the methodology that enables the development of such a model. Firstly, this report will establish a state-of-the-art on the subject. Subsequently, we will present and put into perspective models from the literature. Finally, the model developed during this internship will be presented.

At the end of this study, the reader will be able to understand the methodological questions of a research internship and the development of a logistics model. The reader will also have acquired the context and challenges of an optimization problem applied to a supply chain.
