## Why a blog ?
One of the things I enjoy the most in life is learning. But learning what ? Well, almost evrything I have at my hand.
Hence, I read, I ask questions and I am attentive to what people tell me. Unfortunately, there is a step I tend to forget: report. 

At the end of this first blog post we will able to understan : why is, reporting what we learned, the key of self-learning ? Why do we often forget this step ?

## Why report ?
Reflecting back to my childhood in primary school, I remember being tasked with maintaining a weekly report book. Looking at it now, I realize that this exercise aimed to encourage me to express, from a distance, what I had observed, learned, and found intriguing during the week. As I matured, these exercises evolved into more complex forms such as projects, internships, or analysis reports. However, when it comes to personal projects or learning something new, I've rarely documented my progress. Why is that?

I noticed that when I learn something new, I experience a surge of enthusiasm. There's a chemical reaction in my brain that accompanies this process; it's exhilarating. Despite the hardness to remember what I learned and the confidence I have in these new subjects, I needed to feel the enthousiasm of learning makes me want to accumulate knowledge. This duality was a bit hard to live, so I sought psychological effects that looks like what is hapening to me. And I found the Dunning–Kruger effect. This psychological bias shows that people with a limited competence in a particular domain overestimate their abilities[^1]. This effect explains why I don't feel that comfortable to study a series of subjects. In fact, when I start to understand something I am over-estimate my knowledge in this topic because I feel too enthousiast and I don't really know how far the subject can go. But deep down inside myself, I don't want to go further in the topic, fearing not to understand concepts. Dooming me to self study subject on their only face. Althought I enjoy writing, I never wrote on any subject I learned by myself. And with this thoughts, I understand why ! Writing on a topic requires a strong basis and a global overview on it.

This little thinking tells us a moral: report on a subject souldn't be forget.

Learning and documentating is a huge part of a self-learning journey. However, merely engaging in these activities doesn't reveal the depth of one's knowledge. The only way to check how far you really know is to write on this topic. It is only at this very step you will see if you know subjects in surface or if you are able to refomulate, vulgarize the subject.

What about the case you are just curious and you don't want too further in a subject ? The answer is simple: you should report what you know anyway. But why ?


## Reporting on Curiosity Topics
What I call a "curiosity topic" is a subject you seek only a basic understanding to grasp its core issues and challenges. What I am saying here is that even for this kind of research, reporting is essential. In my view, it's the most effective way to remember these fleeting bits of knowledge that we tend to forget so quickly. Furthermore, I believe that writing should always be part of the learning process, for the same reasons outlined earlier. Lastly, it's inherently gratifying. There's joy in sharing what we've learned and crafting a well-articulated report or post. In today's fast-paced world, where everything demands immediacy, we must acknowledge that the learning process is neither quick nor easy.
